# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices based on various features.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predicting house prices accurately is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can estimate house prices based on various influencing factors.

## 💡 Concept
The project leverages regression techniques to predict house prices by analyzing historical data. The dataset includes various attributes like location, size, number of bedrooms, and other features that affect property valuation.
